## What's here

This repo contains all the files for a <a href="https://jekyllgov.github.io/webinar/" target="_blank">demo site</a>, powered by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, prepared for a webinar presented to the National Association of Government Web Professionals on Oct 24, 2017. 

Jekyll is a static site generator, combining the speed, security, and customizability of static web content with templating. 

Most site content lives in the _posts folder; these markdown files serve as the slide deck for the webinar presentation. 

Layouts are built with open-source template language <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/" target="_blank">Liquid</a>. 

## Updating content 

More technical users can produce and edit content within Github or in their preferred text editor. 

Less technical users can use a tool like <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/" target="_blank">CloudCannon</a>, which provides a GUI for authoring markdown files and inline editing of any HTML content the site developer has given **class="editable"**.

## Hosting

Jekyll is the engine behind <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a>, which offers free hosting of Jekyll sites stored in Github repositories. This site is hosted for free on Github's servers.
