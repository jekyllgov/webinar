## Way back in 2008...

Software systems consisted of a mix of off-shelf-software and custom software.

- Everything was installed in house. That was the only choice.
- Security was often implemented by hiding software behind a firewall and by restricting access to the computers that were connected to the (local) network.
- Software typically didn't have any kind of API, certainly not a web API, so data integrations where accomplished using low level tools and sometimes by hacking directly into databases.
- Lots of hardware required, which requires more people to administer them.
  - In my experience, teams of ~20 system admins and developers
- Everything was expensive.
  - Racks of hardware, software licenses, complicated installations, constant patching, keeping backups of everything (yeah, right)
- More humans, making more mistakes, using primitive tools.
