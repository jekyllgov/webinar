## Sweeping declaration

**No matter which Content Management System you choose, it's the wrong one.**

### Trade-offs

- If it is good for users, it is bad for designers.
- If it is good for designers, it is bad for users or developers.

### Common Issues

- Developers refuse to learn template languages.
- Designers refuse to learn the backend language or APIs of developer-friendly systems.
- Users won't follow style guides, but they want more freedom to make their pages "pop."
- Heavily customized pages make content bad for applications that might need the same content. And they make redesigns harder.
- Who knows the content well enough and has the time to keep it up to date?
- Does IT have staff to integrate services into the site, or will they not touch the Content Management System?
