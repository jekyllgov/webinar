If this doesn't sound familiar, congratulations. Your organization isn't dysfunctional.

## For the rest of us...

The website is still an afterthought. It may be seen as a way to save money, but it is maintained by people who aren't web professionals.

- Quality content requires a communications staff with real control of messaging.
- Controlling functionality requires an IT department with a clear development roadmap, funding and staffing
- Keeping content up to date requires subject matter experts to know every piece of content their work could impact, and to know the process for keeping it up to date the moment a change occurs.

**No city has all three.**
