## Give it a *REST*

- Content Management Systems aren't silver bullets to solve process problems
- Most Content Management Systems aren't going to integrate with the services you use.
- You will need developers to connect the dots, but is what they build usable somewhere else?

## The data may already be there
- Accela
- Socrata
- ESRI
- If there isn't an API, there's probably a way to make one.

Why are we making users pull double duty?
