## What are you buying in a CMS?

1. User management (permissions and workflow)
1. Editor software to interact with content
2. A database to house the content
3. Some way to stage/version control content
4. A way to pull content into templates or skins
5. (Usually) A tool for building form ... that usually just email you

These tasks are spread duplicated in multiple systems already, so how you combine these suites of software requires a strategy.
