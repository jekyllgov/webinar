- I worked with Brian on the CFW project. My contributions included adding automation, building tools and plugins, and trying to make it as easy as possible for Brian and his team to use CFW datasets in their websites.
- I had an epiphany many years ago that we were all building web applications the wrong way.
- Before the CFW project, I unsuccessfully attempted to convince my previous company to redesign their website using a static site solution.
- Developers should not pretend to be a designers or writers, especially me. I try to get people with all skill sets involved in the development process.
- I'm solving the same software problems today that I was 10 years ago, but everything about the solutions has changed.
