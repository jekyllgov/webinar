## Today

Software systems still consist of a mix of off-shelf-software and custom software. However, off-the-shelf software now comes in the form of software-as-a-service.

- The cloud can host it, compute it, and store it cheaper and better than we can do it ourselves.
  - Software-as-a-service doesn't need to be installed or maintained by us, and you can be up in running in minutes with a credit card.
  - It might cost $10/user per month compared to thousands (sometimes millions) of dollars up front.
- My job now consists of integrating software-as-a-service using APIs and filling in the gaps where necessary.
  - Integrations follow standards (HTTP, REST, etc.).
  - Database hacks no longer required.
- Security is still a challenge. In some ways, it's even more difficult.
- From businesses, to political campaigns, to Major League Baseball, everybody is using data to drive their decisions.
