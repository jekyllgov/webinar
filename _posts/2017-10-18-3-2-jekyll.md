**How can we get away from all-in-one systems and complex production environments?** Get content management down to the bare bones.

## Pre-processing our way forward

- The hottest thing is web technology is making authoring dynamic and product static.
- SASS, LESS, PostCSS, CoffeeScript, TypeScript -- All give us some additional conventions to make collaboration easier and to make authoring web content less tedious while standards catch up.
- CMSes brought some of this to HTML content, so Jekyll fills that gap.

## Jekyll

- Easily the most popular static-site generator (maintained by GitHub).
- Flexible data structure; templating.
- Authoring tools to pre-process out the junk before publishing.
- Let's designers handle some of their own formatting requests instead of depending on developers to change output.
- Gives designers the ability to use structured data in their templates
