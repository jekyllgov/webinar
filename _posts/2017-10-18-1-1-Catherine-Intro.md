## 8 years ago, the City of Meridian purchased a silver bullet CMS

- Over 10,000 content pieces were published using this CMS
- While web standards evolved, the CMS lagged behind
- IT staff, Communications staff and content creators grew increasingly dissatisfied with the CMS
- In Nov 2016, the City hired its first in-house web developer

## The job:

- Get content out of the existing CMS
- Ideally, make the site static
- Improve speed, seo, and security
- Increase design control
- Provide a way for content creators to build and edit pages

## The strategy:

- Look for cities with static sites
- Ask how that's working out for them
- Learn from their experiences
- Select and implement a solution
