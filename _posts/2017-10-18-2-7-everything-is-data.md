## Everything is data, and data is everything

- Static files (JSON, Markdown, HTML, CSS, etc.) can be treated just like data.
- Content is just data that has been prepared for humans.
- Exposing static data is much easier to secure than exposing software.
  - All running software is susceptible to hacking. You can't hack a static file.
- It's just data, so you can easily read it, write it, and transform it with software. You have the flexibility to fit it into any part of your build pipeline or other automated software workflows.
- You get speed for free. All web servers are good at serving and caching static files.
- Why wait for your users to ask for content before you prepare it? Have it sitting there waiting for them as soon as they ask for it.
  - Prepare your human readable content and machine readable data at build time instead of at run time.
