- Started with the City of Fort Worth during the transition to the first CMS-driven website.
- Trained users; conducted content workshops; played tech support
- Discovered IT didn't understand how to make a modern web front end, so I learned HTML/CSS/Javascript
- Created new templates, improved performance, but still fought IT and users trying to keep content (and training) up to date.
- The CMS we had required too much developer background to get templating tools I needed.
- Needed a new system to reflect how we were working, hoped IT would start building data services through new Socrata portal.
