## Way back in 2008...

Software systems consisted of a mix of off-shelf-software and custom software.

- Everything was installed in house. That was the only choice.
- Security was often implemented by hiding software behind a firewall and by restricting access to the computers that were connected to the (local) network.
- Software typically didn't have any kind of API, certainly not a web API, so data integrations where accomplished using low level tools and sometimes by hacking directly into databases.
- Lots of hardware required, which requires more people to administer them.
  - In my experience, teams of ~20 system admins and developers
- Everything was expensive.
  - Racks of hardware, software licenses, complicated installations, constant patching, keeping backups of everything (yeah, right)
- More humans, making more mistakes, using primitive tools.

## Today

Software systems still consist of a mix of off-shelf-software and custom software. However, off-the-shelf software now comes in the form of software-as-a-service.

- The cloud can host it, compute it, and store it cheaper and better than we can do it ourselves.
  - Software-as-a-service doesn't need to be installed or maintained by us, and you can be up in running in minutes with a credit card.
  - It might cost $10/user per month compared to thousands (sometimes millions) of dollars up front.
- My job now consists of integrating software-as-a-service using APIs and filling in the gaps where necessary.
  - Integrations follow standards (HTTP, REST, etc.).
  - Database hacks no longer required.
- Security is still a challenge. In some ways, it's even more difficult.
- From businesses, to political campaigns, to Major League Baseball, everybody is using data to drive their decisions.
