**How can we get away from all-in-one systems and complex production environments?** Giving up the CMS doesn't mean losing the tools.


## Enter Jekyll

- Easily the most popular static-site generator (maintained by GitHub).
- Flexible data structure; templating.
- Gives designers the ability to manipulate data to fit templates and styles without interfering with users.
- Let's designers handle some of their own formatting requests instead of depending on developers to change output.
- Gives designers the ability to use structured data in their templates

## Decide what you need

- Build a self-contained site and ship it.
- Version control it and use a collaborative site like Github.
- Upgrade to Continuous Integration (the most CMS-like non-CMS way to go)
- Use third-party tools to open editing of specific parts of the pages.
- Or just use it as a content workflow for a data feed.

Jekyll is a toolbox of powerful workflow tools for web professionals, but it leaves room for developers to empower designers.
